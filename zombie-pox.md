**Information Document: Zombie Pox (ZP)**

**Date Issued:** October 26, 2023

**I. Introduction**

This document provides information regarding Zombie Pox (ZP), a highly infectious and potentially fatal disease currently under investigation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This document is intended for public health officials, healthcare providers, and the general public.

**II. Etiology and Transmission**

Zombie Pox (ZP) is a novel infectious disease believed to be caused by a [**REDACTED DUE TO ONGOING INVESTIGATION**] viral agent. Initial studies suggest the primary mode of transmission is through:

*   **Direct Contact:** Contact with bodily fluids (e.g., blood, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid) of infected individuals.
*   **Airborne Transmission:** Prolonged exposure in enclosed spaces with infected individuals is suspected to contribute to transmission.
*   **Vector-Borne Transmission:** Ongoing investigations are exploring the potential for arthropod vectors (e.g., mosquitoes, ticks) to transmit the disease.
*   **Contaminated Surfaces:** The virus can potentially survive on surfaces for a limited duration, posing a risk of infection through contact.

**III. Symptoms and Progression**

The incubation period for ZP is currently estimated to be [**REDACTED DUE TO ONGOING INVESTIGATION**] days. Symptoms can vary in severity but often progress in distinct stages:

*   **Early Stage (Prodromal):**
    *   Fever (often high)
    *   Severe Headache
    *   Muscle Aches and Joint Pain
    *   Fatigue and Malaise
    *   Gastrointestinal Distress (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)

*   **Intermediate Stage:**
    *   Skin Lesions: Characterized by small, raised, erythematous papules that develop into fluid-filled vesicles. These lesions can be intensely pruritic.
    *   Neurological Changes: Progressive confusion, disorientation, and cognitive impairment.
    *   Motor Dysfunction: Muscle weakness, tremors, and impaired coordination.

*   **Late Stage:**
    *   Severe Neurological Deterioration: Loss of consciousness, seizures, and coma.
    *   Cellular Necrosis: Evidenced by tissue degeneration in infected cells.
    *   **[REDACTED DUE TO GRAPHIC CONTENT]**
    *   Death is a common outcome in the late stage of the disease.

**IV. Diagnosis**

ZP diagnosis is currently complex and relies on a combination of clinical presentation and laboratory testing. Confirmatory testing involves [**REDACTED DUE TO SENSITIVE INFORMATION**] which are available at designated CDC-approved laboratories.

**V. Treatment and Prevention**

*   **Treatment:** Currently, there is no known cure for ZP. Treatment is primarily supportive and aimed at managing symptoms.
*   **Prevention:**
    *   **Avoid Contact:** Avoid direct contact with individuals exhibiting symptoms consistent with ZP.
    *   **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):** Healthcare workers and first responders should use appropriate PPE, including gloves, gowns, eye protection, and respirators, when interacting with suspected cases.
    *   **Hygiene:** Practice meticulous hand hygiene with frequent handwashing using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
    *   **Isolation:** Suspected or confirmed cases should be isolated to prevent further transmission.
    *   **Environmental Decontamination:** Thorough disinfection of potentially contaminated surfaces is crucial. Use EPA-approved disinfectants effective against [**REDACTED**].

**VI. Reporting**

Zombie Pox is a nationally notifiable disease. Healthcare providers are required to report suspected or confirmed cases immediately to their local and state health departments. State health departments should then report to the CDC through established channels.

**VII. Public Health Recommendations**

*   Stay informed: Monitor official CDC and local health department websites for the latest information and recommendations.
*   Follow public health guidelines: Adhere to recommendations regarding social distancing, mask-wearing, and other preventative measures as advised by public health officials.
*   Prepare an emergency kit: Assemble a kit containing essential supplies, including food, water, medications, and personal hygiene items, in case of widespread outbreak.

**VIII. Ongoing Research**

The CDC is actively engaged in ongoing research to:

*   Fully characterize the [**REDACTED**] agent responsible for ZP.
*   Develop diagnostic tools for rapid and accurate detection.
*   Identify potential therapeutic interventions.
*   Understand the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of ZP.
